<h6 align="center">A unified NixOS management tool.</h6>

## Introduction

Tooling for `nixos` has become quite scattered, and as a result, NixOS can be
pretty obtuse to use. There are many community tools available to fix the
problem, but no all-in-one solution.

`nixos-cli` is exactly that - an all-in-one tool to manage any NixOS
installation with ease, that consists of:

- Drop-in replacements for NixOS scripts and tools like `nixos-rebuild`
- Generation manager and option preview TUIs
- Many more

All available through an easy-to-use (and pretty!) interface.

High-level documentation is available as a
[website](https://nix-community.github.io/nixos-cli), while a detailed reference
for each command and settings is available in the form of man pages after
installation.

## Development

This application is written in [Go](https://go.dev).

There are two major directories to keep in mind:

- `cmd/` :: command structure, contains actual main command implementations
- `internal/` :: anything that is shared between commands, categorized by
  functionality

Each command and subcommand **MUST** go in their own package and match the
command tree that it implements.

All dependencies for this project are neatly provided in a Nix shell. Run
`nix develop .#` or use [`direnv`](https://direnv.net) to automatically drop
into this Nix shell on changing to this directory.

In order to build both packages at the same time, run
`nix build .#{nixos,nixosLegacy}`.

### Documentation

Documentation is split into two parts:

- A documentation website, built using
  [`mdbook`](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/)
- Manual pages (`man` pages), generated using
  [`scdoc`](https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/scdoc/)

They are both managed with a build script at [doc/build.go](./doc/build.go), and
with the following Makefile rules:

- `make gen-manpages` :: generate `roff`-formatted man pages with `scdoc`
- `make gen-site` :: automatically generate settings/module docs for website
- `make serve-site` :: start a preview server for the `mdbook` website.

`make gen-site` generates two files:

- Documentation for all available settings in `config.toml`
- Module documentation for `services.nixos-cli`, built using
  [`nix-options-doc`](https://github.com/Thunderbottom/nix-options-doc)

The rest of the site documentation files are located in [doc/man](./doc/src).

`make gen-manpages` generates man pages using `scdoc`, and generates one
additional man page file from a template: the available settings for
`nixos-cli-config(5)`.

Check the build script source for more information on how to work with this.

### Versioning

Version numbers are handled using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
They are also managed using Git tags; every version has a Git tag named with the
version; the tag name does not have a preceding "v".

Non-released builds have a version number that is suffixed with `"-dev"`. As
such, a tag should always exist on a version number change (which removes the
suffix), and the very next commit will re-introduce the suffix.

Once a tag is created and pushed, create a GitHub release off this tag.

The version number is managed inside the Nix derivation at
[package.nix](./package.nix).

### CI

The application must build successfully upon every push to `main`, and this is a
prerequisite for every patch or pull request to be merged.

Cache artifacts are published in a Cachix cache at https://watersucks.cachix.org
when a release is triggered.

## Talk!

Join the Matrix room at
[#nixos-cli:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#nixos-cli:matrix.org)! It's open
for chatting about NixOS in general, and for making it a better experience for
all that involved.

I would like for this to become a standard NixOS tool, which means that I want
to cater to potentially many interests. If you would like for any commands to be
implemented that you think fit this project, talk to me on Matrix or file a
GitHub issue.
