# Roadmap

- ❌ Remote application of configurations
- ❌ Remote installation of NixOS configurations (a la
  [`nixos-anywhere`](https;//github.com/numtide/nixos-anywhere))
- ❌ Ability to remotely manage generations
- ❌ Smart container management (a la `nixos-container`)
- ❌ Explicit ability to deploy systems from non-NixOS operating systems
- ❌ **Drafting an RFC** to make `nixos-cli` the default NixOS management tool

See the [Issues](https://github.com/water-sucks/nixos/issues) section in the
